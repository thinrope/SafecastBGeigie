Binary releases version naming

bGeigieMini-1.3.10_001111.hex
            X.Y.Z  abcdef

X.Y.Z	:	version in the general sense
abcdef	:	compile options
	a:	ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC
	b:	PLUSSHIELD
	c:	JAPAN_POST
	d:	TX_ENABLED
	e:	GPS_PROGRAMMING
	f:	GPS_TYPE

I know it is ugly, but some of those options will be moved to execute time
later on.
